PROJECT_PROBLEM = f"""<h2>The Problem Statement</h2> 
<p>The healthcare sector faces significant challenges, 
especially in underserved regions, where access to quality care remains limited. 
Global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have further highlighted the disparities 
in healthcare services, particularly in early disease detection, mental health support, 
and access to trained professionals. Many diseases, including Alzheimer's, cancer, pneumonia, and COVID-19, 
require early detection for effective treatment, yet resources are not equally distributed globally. 
Additionally, mental health services remain inadequate in many parts of the world, 
leaving individuals without immediate support during emotional distress. 
These challenges underscore the urgent need for innovative, accessible solutions 
that ensure everyone, regardless of location or financial means, can access proactive, 
high-quality healthcare and emotional support. LokahiCare is designed to address these 
issues by offering advanced AI-powered tools and video consultations to bridge the healthcare gap.</p>"""
