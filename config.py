PROJECT_PROBLEM = f"""<h2>The Problem Statement</h2> <p>The healthcare sector is grappling with numerous challenges that have been
exacerbated by the global disparity in healthcare access and the impact of recent health
crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite advancements in medical technology,
significant barriers remain in early disease detection and mental health support,
particularly in underserved and developing regions. This disparity is further widened by
a shortage of healthcare professionals, limited access to advanced diagnostic tools,
and the high cost of medical services. Diseases like Alzheimer's, lung cancer,
pneumonia, tuberculosis, and COVID-19 require early detection for effective treatment,
yet the resources for such diagnostics are unevenly distributed globally. Moreover, the
mental health sector suffers from a lack of accessible and immediate support for
individuals facing emotional distress, contributing to a global crisis where care is often
reactive rather than proactive. These challenges underscore the urgent need for
innovative solutions that democratize access to healthcare services, ensuring timely
and equitable healthcare support for all, regardless of geographic or economic status.<br>
